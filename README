Karaoke Flow
Ben Turner

Project for John Schimmel's Dynamic Web Development class.

Party game.  People get 5 minutes to create rhymes from a prompt of 2 common rap
topics.  Then when time's up, someone has to perform the song and should be
judged on his/her flow!

Last update 06 Mar 12:  Functional from start to end.

TODO:
-random flow made up of past rhymes
-insert choruses
-insert random rappers' rhymes
-add more phat beats (from Raj?)
-karaoke highlighting line-by-line for performance?
-hook up to microphone & beat machine & recorder?

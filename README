Project for John Schimmel's Dynamic Web Development class.

2nd week's homework assignment:

As we start to move towards starting a web server and database we need to think about the visual
front-end HTML. For next week,
 -Create a simple form that will collect mulitple fields of data, these can include textboxes,
  checkboxes, drop lists, etc.  Include a save or submit button on the form.
 -Implement a 'click' event on the Save/Submit button that will use a piece of data from your
  form. The 'click' event could use the alert() function or it could add dynamic HTML elements
  to the web page.
 -Save your HTML and JavaScript in a Git repository (directory).

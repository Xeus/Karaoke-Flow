Karaoke Flow http://karaokeflow.herokuapp.com/

Project for John Schimmel's Dynamic Web Development class.

Party game.  People get 5 minutes to create rhymes from a prompt of 2 common rap
topics.  Then when time's up, someone has to perform the song and should be
judged on his/her flow!

Last update 02 Apr 12:  Added some JSON/REST, AJAX updates for rhymes.

TODO:
-insert choruses
-insert random rappers' rhymes
-add more phat beats (from Raj?)
-karaoke highlighting line-by-line for performance? (partial)
-hook up to microphone & beat machine & recorder?
